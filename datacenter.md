## E.Datacenter.2.b

The NSA Bumblehive datacenter, otherwise known as the Utah Data Center,
is a large government data center used by the NSA to intercept and
analyze up to 100 years of communications data.  The data center
performs scientific computing instead of on-demand computing compared to
public data centers, which allows it to operate at peak performance all
of the time, making it much more efficient.  The total operating cost is
upwards of $40 million a year, in addition to the cost of 1.5 million
gallons of water a day being pumped in to cool the servers. This data
center has the 8th highest power consumption of data centers worldwide. 
The proposal and development of the data center faced immediate backlash
in 2013/2014, due to growing economic and environmental concerns about
the value of the data center being used for "spyware". Many of the
actual details and blueprints regarding the development are classified,
but various estimators and experts have guessed that the facilty can
hold/process anywhere between 3-12 exabytes of data.  The data center
campus as a whole takes up 1m sq. ft. of space, however the server
structure takes up only 10% of that space.

### Thermal Energy

Geothermal energy is used pretty rarely in data centers, but many data
centers that use geothermal energy end up with a LEED (Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design) platinum certification.

An example of a unique geothermal use is the American College Testing in
Iowa, which doesn't use geothermal energy, but instead thermal cooling
in order to remove waste heat from the servers.  Many sources involved
with the project identified it as one designed for sustainability.

Another example of this type of geothermal cooling is present in Prairie
Bunkers, a 760-acre data center in Nebraska with geo-thermal cooling. 
It, however is especially unique as it is one of the first projects
designed in a nuke-proof data bunkers.

### Google's Renewable Energy Efforts

Google is making a large effort to introduce and upgrade their renewable
energy sources in order to cut their environmental impacts.  They have
invested upwards of $3 billion in their renewable energy projects and
plan to grow the industry in a renewable manner.  One particular way
that this has been implemented is using a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)
with clean energy producers in the region of their data centers. 
Google's successes with this project include their milestone in 2017,
reaching 100% renewable energy to match their consumption by data
centers.

### Azure Data Center Outage

In 2018, a lightning strike caused over 40 data center services to go
down in the South-Central region of the US.  Luckily, this outage
happened about a year after Azure implemented their multi-zone
availability strategy that Google and AWS had implemented much earlier. 
This allowed the services to replicate themselves for protection for an
instance like this.  This still affected an undisclosed number of
customers, as well as several Office 365 cloud-based services, which
caused it to impact a mixture of corporations, organizations, and home
users.  One of the largest impacts of this outage was Azure DevOps,
lasting over a day.  The outage demonstrated some large failures with
their system, as they didn't implement seamless failovers or backups.
