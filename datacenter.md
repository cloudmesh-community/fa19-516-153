The NSA Bumblehive datacenter, otherwise known as the Utah Data Center, is a large government data center used by the NSA to intercept and analyze up to 100 years of communications data.  The data center performs scientific computing instead of on-demand computing compared to public data centers, which allows it to operate at peak performance all of the time, making it much more efficient.  The total operating cost is upwards of $40 million a year, in addition to the cost of 1.5 million gallons of water a day being pumped in to cool the servers. This data center has the 8th highest power consumption of data centers worldwide.  The proposal and development of the data center faced immediate backlash in 2013/2014, due to growing economic and environmental concerns about the value of the data center being used for "spyware".
Many of the actual details and blueprints regarding the development are classified, but various estimators and experts have guessed that the facilty can hold/process anywhere between 3-12 exabytes of data.  The data center campus as a whole takes up 1m sq. ft. of space, however the server structure takes up only 10% of that space.
